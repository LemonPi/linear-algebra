## example vector spaces
- R2 is a plane, containing all ordered pairs of R
	- R2 = {(x,y) : x,y E R}
- R3 is ordinary space, containing all ordered triples of R
	- R3 = {(x,y,z) : x,y,z E R}

## lists
- a **list** has **length** n, where n is a non-negative integer
- also known as n-tuple
- is an ordered collection of n objects
	- objects could be numbers, other lists, or more abstract entities
	- object type is homogenous
- separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses
	- (x_1,...,x_n)
- for j E {1,...,n}, x_j is the jth **coordinate** of the list
- by definition of n has a finite length, so (x_1, x_2, ...) is not a list
- () is a list of length 0
	- defined to avoid trivial exceptions in theorems
- two lists are equal if their lengths are equal and the corresponding coordinates are equal


## more general examples
- higher dimensional analogues of R2 and R3
	- n is a positive integer
	- Fn = {(x_1,...,x_n) : x_j E F for j = 1,...,n}
		- convention is that if a single letter denotes an element of Fn, then subscripts denote that element's coordinate
			- x E Fn, then x is (x_1,...,x_n)
			- mostly work with x and avoid explicit coordinates if possible
- 0 = (0,...,0) context makes clear what 0 refers to
	- for x E Fn, x + 0 = x is clearly using 0 as a list because addition with a number is not defined
- elements of R2 can be geometrically represented as points or vectors
	- when thought of as an arrow, we refer to it as a **vector**
	- (2, -3, 17, pi, sqrt(2)) is an element in R5 and can be also referred to as a point or vector
		- don't need to worry about geometric or physical meaning
- addition in R2 involves moving arrows parallel to themselves
	- moving parallel to themselves without changing meaning is also true generally

## definition
- motivation for defining a vector space comes from properties of addition and scalar multiplication on Fn
- a vector space is **a set V along with an addition and scalar multiplication on V satifsying properties** 
	- addition is a function mapping each u,v E V --> u + v E V
	- scalar multiplication is a function mapping each a E F and each v E V --> av E V
	- formal properties
		- commutativity u + v = v + u for all u,v E V
		- associativity (u + v) + w = u  + (v + w) and (ab)v = a(bv) for all u,v,w E V, and all a,b E F
		- additive identity there exists an element 0 E V s.t. v + 0 = v for all v E V
		- additive inverse for every v E V, there exists w E V s.t. v + w = 0
		- multiplicative identity 1v = v for all v E V
		- distributive properties a(u + v) = au + av and (a + b)u = au + bu for all a,b E F and all u,v E V
	- scalar multiplication in a vector space depends on F
		- more precisely V is a vector space over F
			- Rn is a vector space over R
			- Cn is a vector space over C
		- usually the choice of F is either obvious from context or irrelevant
			- so often goes without mention
- elements of a vector space are called vectors or points

## more exotic/interseting examples
- trivial vector space of {0} is valid but not interesting
- Finf is one instance of Fn and is a valid vector space
	- Finf = {(x1, x2, ...) : xj E F for j = 1,2,...}
	- addition defined as (x1, x2, ...) + (y1, y2, ...) = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, ...)
	- scalar multiplication defined as a(x1, x2, ...) = (ax1, ax2, ...)
- polynomials
	- function f: F --> F is called a polynomial with coefficients in F 
	  if there exists a0, ..., am E F s.t. p(z) = a0 + a1*z + a2*z^2 + ... + am*z^m for all z E F
	- we define P(F) to be the set of all polynomials with coefficients in F
		- addition: if p,q E P(F), then p + q is the polynomial where (p + q)(z) = p(z) + q(z)
			- p(z) = 2z + z^3
			- q(z) = 7 + 4z
			- (p + q)(z) = 7 + 6z + z^3
		- scalar multiplication: if a E F and p E P(F) then ap is the polynomial where (ap)(z) = ap(z)
			- p(z) = 2z + z^3
			- (5p)(z) = 5(2z + z^3)
	- verify
		- commutativity
			- (p + q)(z) = p(z) + q(z)
			- = q(z) + p(z) by commutativity of F (since p(z) and q(z) E F)
			- = (q + p)(z) by definition of addition
			- therefore commutativity holds
		- associativity
			- ((p + q) + r)(z) = (p + q)(z) + r(z) = p(z) + q(z) + r(z) by definition
			- (p + (q + r))(z) = p(z) + (q + r)(z) = p(z) + q(z) + r(z) by definition
			- they are equal and associativity holds
		- additive identity
			- (p + 0)(z) = p(z) + 0(z) = p(z)
			- 0(z) = 0 for all z E F
			- this polynomial exists and has all 0 coefficients
		- additive inverse
			- (p + -p)(z) = p(z) + (-p)(z) = 0
			- -p(z) = (-p)(z)
			- this polynomial exists and has bi = -ai for all coefficients ai, i E 0, ... m, of p(z)
			- (-p)(z) = -a0 + -a1*z + -a2*z^2 + ... + -am*z^m for all z E F by definition of polynomials
			- = -(a0 + a1*z + a2*z^2 + ... + am*z^m) by distribution of -1 on F
			- = -p(z) by definition of p(z)
		- multplicative identity
			- (ap)(z) = ap(z) = p(z)
			- a exists and is equal to the multplicative identity of F (1), which exists
		- distributive properties
			- too lazy, verify later?
	- demonstrates that not all vector spaces consist of lists
		- P(F) elements consist of functions on F, not lists
