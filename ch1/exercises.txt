## exercises
1. find c, d E R != 0 s.t. 1/(a + bi) = c + di
	1 = (c + di)(a + bi)
	1 = ca + cbi + dai - db
	1 = ca - db and 0 = cb + da
		a = ca^2 - dba
		0 = cb^2 + dba
		a = ca^2 + cb^2
		c = a/(a^2 + b^2)

		b = cba - db^2
		0 = cba + da^2
		b = -db^2 - da^2
		d = -b/(a^2 + b^2)

2. show that (-1 + sqrt(3)i) / 2 is a cube root of 1
	(-1 + sqrt(3)i) * (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/4
	= (1 - 2sqrt(3)i - 3)/4
	= (-2 - 2sqrt(3)i)/4
	= (-1 - sqrt(3)i)/2
	(1 - (-1)*3)/4
	= 4/4
	= 1

3. prove that -(-v) = v for v E V
	0 = -v + v by definition of inverse
	-(-v) = v

4. prove that if a E F, v E V, and av = 0, then a = 0 or v = 0
	suppose av = 0 and a != 0, v != 0
	since a != 0 we can divide by a
	v = 0 contradiction
	therefore either a = 0 or v = 0

5. a) x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 = 0
		0 = 0 + 2*0 + 3*0 so additive identity exists

		x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + (y1 + 2y2 + 3y3) = 0 + 0
		= (x1 + y1) + 2(x2 + y2) + 3(x3 + y3) = 0
		let ui = xi + yi, u1 + 2u2 + 3u3 = 0 so closed under addition

		a(x1 + 2x2 + 3x3) = a * 0 = 0
		let ui = a*xi, ... closed under scalar *

		is a subspace

	b) F3's additive identity is (0,0,0)
		0 + 2*0 + 3*0 != 4
		not a subspace due to lack of additive identity

	c)	0*0*0 = 0
		additive identity is fine

		(x1,x2,x3) + (y1,y2,y3) = (x1+y1, x2+y2, x3+y3) under F3's addition defintion
		(x1+y1)*(x2+y2)*(x3+y3) = 0
		is not necessary true, for example
		(1, 1, 0) + (0, 0, 1) = (1, 1, 1)
		1*1*1 != 0
		not a subspace due to lack of closure
		under vector addition

	d)	(0,0,0) -> 0 = 5*0
		additive identity is fine

		x1 + y1 = 5x3 + 5y3
		= 5(x3 + y3)
		fine, so closed under vector addition

		a*x1 = a*5x3
		a*x1 = 5(a*x3)
		fine, so closed under scalar multiplication

		is a subspace

6. give an example of a nonempty subset U of R2
s.t. U is closed under addition and under taking
additive inverses, but U is not a subspace of R2

	Always having inverses and being closed under
	addition means u + -u = 0 the additive identity
	must be in the set.

	The only property left is scalar multiplication
	so it must not satisfy this.

	intuitively can think of this as being bounded by extent since scalar multiplication "scales" the vector,
	but how can we not have closed scalar multiplication if addition and inverse is closed?

	We can always add copies of the same vector
	to multiply it by an integer, so the trick must
	be to restrict non-integer multiples.

	{(x1, x2) E R2: x1 = ceil(x1)}

	(0,0) is contained because 0 = ceil(0)
	this is closed under vector addition because
	x1 + y1 = ceil(x1) + ceil(y1) = ceil(x1 + y1)

	consider a = 0.5 and u = (1,0)
	a*u = (0.5, 0) and 0.5 != ceil(0.5) = 1


7. closed under scalar * but not subspace of R2
	need cone passing through origin
	{(x1,x2) E R2 : |x1| >= |x2|}

	clearly a|x1| >= a|x2| since we can divide away a
	if not 0, and 0 >= 0 if a = 0

	consider (-1,1) + (1,1) = (0,2)

8. prove that the intersection of any collection of subspaces of V is a subspace of V
	since each subspace must contain the additive identity, their intersection must also contain it

	consider two vectors u,v E U1, U2, ... Un (contained in each of the subspaces under consideration so is part of the intersection),
	then u + v E U1, U2, ... Un because each subspace
	is closed under addition, and so the intersect
	is closed under vector addition

	similar arugment holds for scalar multiplication

9. prove that the union of two subspaces U1, U2 of V is a subspace of V iff U1 or U2 contains the other
	The forward direction is easy.
	Suppose U1 contains U2, then U1 union U2 = U1,
	which is a subspace

	For the backward direction consider u, a vector
	that's in U1 but not in U2 and v, a vector in U2
	that's not in U1

	u = x1 + x2 since U1 is a subspace and any vector
	can be described as the sum of two others given
	closure under vector addition

	v = y1 + y2 since U2 is a subspace with the same
	argument. Then u + v E union because x1, x2, y1, y2 E union and u + v = x1 + x2 + y1 + y2
	??? I don't intuitively see why it has to contain the other

	maybe the argument goes that for u to not be in
	U2, x1 and x2 must also not be in U2, then this
	argument can be extended to all vectors until
	just the additive identity remains, in which case
	they become equal and contain each other.

10. Suppose U is a subspace of V. What is U + U?
	U because U is closed under vector addition since it's a subspace,
	so U + U introduces no new elements

11. Is subspace addition commutative? Associative?
	It's commutative because it results in the set of pairwise sums,
	and that's commutative since vector addition is commutative.

	... similar argument for scalar multiplicatin

12. Does the addition on subspaces of V have an additive identity?
	Set containing just the additive identity because every other subspace
	must contain this set, and adding it to each vector just returns that vector
	Additive inverses do not exist - what would that entail for subspace addition?
	Two subspaces added together to form the additive identity set?
	By definition of subspace addition that can't exist.

13. if U1 + W = U2 + W then we can describe every element of U1 + W as
	u1 + w = u2 + w, where u1 is some vector from U1, u2 is some vector from U2, and w is some vector from W

	u1 + w - w = u2 + w - w
	u1 = u2 for all such vectors, so U1 = U2

14. Suppose U is the subspace of P(F) consisting of p(z) = az^2 + bz^5, a,b E F.
	Find a subspace W of P(F) s.t. P(F) = U ++ W

15. Same problem as 13
