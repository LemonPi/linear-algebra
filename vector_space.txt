## example vector spaces
- R2 is a plane, containing all ordered pairs of R
	- R2 = {(x,y) : x,y E R}
- R3 is ordinary space, containing all ordered triples of R
	- R3 = {(x,y,z) : x,y,z E R}

## lists
- a **list** has **length** n, where n is a non-negative integer
- also known as n-tuple
- is an ordered collection of n objects
	- objects could be numbers, other lists, or more abstract entities
	- object type is homogenous
- separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses
	- (x_1,...,x_n)
- for j E {1,...,n}, x_j is the jth **coordinate** of the list
- by definition of n has a finite length, so (x_1, x_2, ...) is not a list
- () is a list of length 0
	- defined to avoid trivial exceptions in theorems
- two lists are equal if their lengths are equal and the corresponding coordinates are equal


## more general examples
- higher dimensional analogues of R2 and R3
	- n is a positive integer
	- Fn = {(x_1,...,x_n) : x_j E F for j = 1,...,n}
		- convention is that if a single letter denotes an element of Fn, then subscripts denote that element's coordinate
			- x E Fn, then x is (x_1,...,x_n)
			- mostly work with x and avoid explicit coordinates if possible
- 0 = (0,...,0) context makes clear what 0 refers to
	- for x E Fn, x + 0 = x is clearly using 0 as a list because addition with a number is not defined
- elements of R2 can be geometrically represented as points or vectors
	- when thought of as an arrow, we refer to it as a **vector**
	- (2, -3, 17, pi, sqrt(2)) is an element in R5 and can be also referred to as a point or vector
		- don't need to worry about geometric or physical meaning
- addition in R2 involves moving arrows parallel to themselves
	- moving parallel to themselves without changing meaning is also true generally
